# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

A personal collection of DSA implementations and practice problems, documenting my journey through fundamental computer science concepts.

## About

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. It's a work in progress as I learn and practice these concepts through coursework and self-study.

## What's Inside

### Data Structures
- **Linear Structures**
  - Arrays and Vectors
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
  - Stacks (Static & Dynamic)
  - Queues
  - Multi-level Lists

### Algorithms
- **Sorting**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  
- **Searching**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

### Learning Materials
The `intro to c++` folder contains foundational concepts:
- Basics (variables, I/O)
- Pointers and References
- Function parameter passing
- Dynamic memory management

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── Week 1/           # Sorting algorithms and searching
├── Week 2/           # Linked lists, insertion sort
├── Week 3/           # Advanced linked list variants
├── intro to c++/     # C++ fundamentals
└── Various implementations and practice files
```

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on:
- Implementing and comparing sorting algorithms
- Understanding time complexity through practical examples
- Building various linked list implementations
- Exploring stack and queue data structures

## Notes

- Code includes both class exercises and personal practice implementations
- Some files contain detailed comments and performance comparisons
- This is an ongoing learning project - expect regular updates

## Work in Progress

This repository is actively being developed as I progress through my DSA studies. Code quality and documentation will improve over time as I refine my understanding.
